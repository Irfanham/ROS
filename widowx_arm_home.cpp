/**
 * Basic homing for the WidowX arm. Joints 1 to 5 are set to 0 degrees.
 * Ana Cruz-Mart√≠n, 2015
 * 
 * DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress and basic code, not finished yet.
 * 
 * This code must be integrated into a ros package, and then called with rosrun,
 * while the widowx arm software by Robotnik is running.
 * https://github.com/RobotnikAutomation/widowx_arm
 *
 * TO DO:
 * - Clean and organize code
 * - Use services for relaxing joints
 * - Open/close gripper
 * - Read joints values
 * - Create a proper launch file
 * - rviz integration
